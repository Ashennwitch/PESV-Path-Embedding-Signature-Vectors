               classification with interpretable feature representation",
  author    = "Cui, Jun and Bai, Longkun and Zhang, Xiaofeng and Lin, Zhigui

  abstract  = "Network traffic classification is crucial for identifying
               network applications and defending against network threats.
               Traditional traffic classification approaches struggle to
               extract structural features and suffer from poor
               interpretability of feature representations. The high symmetry
               between network traffic classification and its interpretable
               feature representation is vital for network traffic analysis. To
               address these issues, this paper proposes a traffic
               classification and feature representation model named the
               attention mechanism autoencoder (AMAE). The AMAE model extracts
               the global spatial structural features of network traffic
               through attention mechanisms and employs an autoencoder to
               extract local structural features and perform dimensionality
               reduction. This process maps different network traffic features
               into one-dimensional coordinate systems in the form of spectra,
               termed FlowSpectrum. The spectra of different network traffic
               represent different intervals in the coordinate system. This
               paper tests the interpretability and classification performance
               of network traffic features of the AMAE model using the
               ISCX-VPN2016 dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that by
               analyzing the overall distribution of attention weights and
               local weight values of network traffic, the model effectively
               explains the differences in the spectral representation
               intervals of different types of network traffic. Furthermore,
               our approach achieves the highest classification accuracy of up
               to 100\% for non-VPN-encrypted traffic and 99.69\% for
               VPN-encrypted traffic, surpassing existing traffic
               classification schemes.",

  abstract  = "The classification of encrypted traffic plays a crucial role in
               network management and security. As encrypted network traffic
               becomes increasingly complicated and challenging to analyze,
               there is a growing need for more efficient and comprehensive
               analytical approaches. Our proposed method introduces a novel
               approach to network traffic classification, utilizing multi-task
               learning to simultaneously train multiple tasks within a single
               model. To validate the proposed method, we conducted experiments
               using the ISCX 2016 VPN/Non-VPN dataset, consisting of three
               tasks. The proposed method outperformed the majority of existing
               methods in classification with 99.29\%, 97.38\%, and 96.89\%
               accuracy in three tasks (i.e., encapsulation, category, and
               application classification, respectively). The efficiency of the
               proposed method also demonstrated outstanding performance when
               compared to methods excluding lightweight models. The proposed
               approach demonstrates accurate and efficient multi-task
               classification on encrypted traffic.",
